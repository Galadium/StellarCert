/**
 * Migration: convert persisted pre-signed profile picture URLs into S3
 * object keys.
 *
 * Background:
 *   StorageService.uploadFile() used to return a pre-signed URL (1 hour
 *   TLF) and that URL was saved into users.profilePicture. After the TTL expired,
 *   every profile picture returned 403. The column now stores the S3 object
 *   key and URLs are signed on-demand.
 *
 * This migration is data-only and idempotent: it only touches rows whose
 * profilePicture looks like an HTTP'URL, extracting the object key from the
 * URL path and stripping the signature query string. Rows that already store
 * a plain key are left untouched.
 *
 * The down migration is a no-op: the original pre-signed URLs are
 * unrecoverable (and expired), and keys remain valid input for the new
 * code path.
